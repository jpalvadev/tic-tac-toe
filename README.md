# Tic Tac Toe

This Project is part of The Odin Project's Curriculum

- [Live Here](https://jpalvadev.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

## Things I learned - getting better at

- Getting confortable with the Revealing Module Pattern.

- IIFEs.

- Learned how to apply the minimax algorithm.

- CSS was a little easier this time.

## Description and considerations

- It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game.
- You can play with a friend or against the computer.
- To apply minimax algorithm I had to change a lot of things halfway through the project, but the AI plays perfectly everytime, so it was worth it.
- You can choose between 3 "difficulty levels". Depending on what you choose the computer will play the best position or will place the mark on a random position
- In the beginning I was thinking to make the UI really simple with not much CSS, but I could not help myself and I gave the UI a Terminator vibe.
- That is all. Thanks to TOP and all the people behind it.
